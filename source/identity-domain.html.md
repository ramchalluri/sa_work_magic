# MaGIC Train PI Design - Identity Domain name change
DTA and Train has decided to use *identity.gov.au* domain instead of *identityhub.my.gov.au*. Currently *identity.gov.au* domain is owned and managed by DTA. Services Australia has put in a request to CEO to transfer the domain to Services Australia and on **2020-04-01** that request has been accepted. 

This paper is to document the tasks involved to migrate the domain name and setup required mappings for various apps. At this time the plan is to use the domain name for the following 

1.  [Customer Dashboard](#CUSTOMER_DASHBOARD)
1.  [Staff support tool](#STAFF_SUPPORT_TOOL)
1.  [Identity Hub](#IDENTITY_HUB_MIGRATION)
1.  [DTA Identity Website redirection](#DTA_WEB_REDIRECT) (Not sure if needed)
